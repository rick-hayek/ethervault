## 📖 Project Overview

EtherVault is built using a Monorepo architecture, with core business logic separated from the UI layer to ensure high code reusability and consistency across platforms. The project features built-in robust local encryption (AES-256), supports end-to-end encrypted synchronization with major cloud storage services (like Google Drive), and integrates advanced features such as biometric unlock and password health analysis. It is dedicated to creating the most secure digital vault for users.

### 1. Google Console Setup (For Cloud Sync)
Before running the app, you need to set up a project in Google Cloud Console to enable Google Drive synchronization:

1.  Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2.  Create a new project (e.g., `ethervault-dev`).
3.  **Enable API**:
    *   Navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**.
    *   Search for **Google Drive API** and enable it.
4.  **Configure OAuth Consent Screen**:
    *   Go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
    *   Select **External** (unless you are a G-Suite user).
    *   Fill in required app information.
    *   Add your email as a **Test User**.
5.  **Create Credentials (Web Client)**:
    *   Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
    *   Click **Create Credentials > OAuth Client ID**.
    *   Application type: **Web application**.
    *   Add Authorized JavaScript origins: `http://localhost:3000` (and `http://localhost:5173` if needed).
    *   Add Authorized redirect URIs: `http://localhost:3000` (and `http://localhost:5173` if needed).
    *   Copy the **Client ID**.
6.  **Create Credentials (iOS Client)**:
    *   Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
    *   Click **Create Credentials > OAuth Client ID**.
    *   Application type: **iOS**.
    *   Add Bundle ID: `com.ethervault.app`.
    *   Copy the **Client ID**.
7.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    *   Create a `.env` file in `packages/app/.env` (copy from `.env.example` if available).
    *   Add your credentials:
        ```bash
        # This is for local development
        VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
        # This is for native application on iOS, Android, and Desktop
        VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_IOS=your_client_id_here
        ```
